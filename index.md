# Privacy Policy — Huna

**Last Updated:** February 12, 2026

Huna is a simple iOS app that helps you save and share delivery addresses in Saudi Arabia. Your privacy matters — here's how the app works.

## How It Works

Huna stores your addresses on your device so you can quickly share them with delivery drivers. That's it.

- **Your addresses stay on your device.** No accounts, no sign-ups, no servers.
- **Location is used only to find your address on the map** when you're creating a new one. The app never tracks you in the background.
- **Photos you attach** to addresses are stored on your device alongside the address — they're never uploaded anywhere.

## What the App Stores

Everything Huna stores is to provide the address-saving service you'd expect:

- Address details (street, building number, district, city, postal code, Saudi Short Code, notes)
- Map coordinates for the pin you placed
- Photos you optionally attach as delivery references
- Google Maps links you optionally add

All of this lives locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData. Nothing is sent to a server.

## Sharing

When you tap share, the address goes directly to the app you choose (like WhatsApp) using the standard iOS share sheet. No middleman, no server — it goes straight from your device to the other app.

## Analytics

The app uses [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com) to collect anonymous usage signals — things like which screens are viewed and which features are used. This helps improve the app.

- TelemetryDeck does **not** collect personal data, device IDs, or IP addresses
- Signals cannot be traced back to you
- No advertising or tracking is involved
- See [TelemetryDeck's privacy policy](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/) for details

## Apple Maps

The app uses Apple Maps to display maps and look up addresses from coordinates or Saudi Short Codes. Apple's own [privacy policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) applies to this.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why | Required? |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| Location (While Using) | Center the map on your location | No — you can move the map manually |
| Camera | Take a photo for an address | No |
| Photo Library | Pick an existing photo | No |

The app works fine if you deny any of these.

## Deleting Your Data

Delete an address in the app and it's gone — including any attached photos. Uninstall the app and everything is removed.
