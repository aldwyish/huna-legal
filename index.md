# Privacy Policy — Huna

**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026

Huna ("the App") is an iOS application that helps you save and share delivery addresses. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your data.

## Data Collection

The App collects and stores the following types of data:

- **Location Data**: GPS coordinates used to place a pin on the map when creating an address. Location is accessed only while the App is in use (no background tracking).
- **Address Information**: Labels, street names, building numbers, districts, cities, postal codes, Saudi Short Codes, and notes that you enter or that are retrieved via Apple Maps reverse geocoding.
- **Photos**: Images you optionally attach to addresses as visual delivery references, captured via camera or selected from your photo library.
- **Google Maps Links**: URLs you optionally provide for address sharing.

## Data Storage

**All data is stored locally on your device.** The App uses Apple's SwiftData framework to persist your addresses and photos directly on-device.

- No data is uploaded to any server.
- No cloud sync or remote backup is performed by the App.
- No accounts or sign-in are required.
- iCloud backup of App data follows your device's standard iCloud backup settings.

## Data Sharing

The App does **not** share your data with any third parties.

When you use the share feature, address details are passed directly to the target app (e.g., WhatsApp) on your device using the iOS share sheet. No intermediary servers are involved. Once shared, the receiving app's privacy policy governs how that data is handled.

## Third-Party Services

- **Apple Maps / MapKit**: Used for map display, reverse geocoding (converting coordinates to addresses), and Saudi Short Code lookup. Apple's privacy policy applies to MapKit usage: [apple.com/privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).
- **No analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs** are included in the App.

## Permissions

The App may request the following permissions, all of which can be denied:

| Permission | Purpose | Required? |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Location Services** (When In Use) | Center the map on your location when creating an address | No — you can manually navigate the map |
| **Camera** | Take photos to attach to an address | No — you can skip photos or use Photo Library |
| **Photo Library** | Select existing photos to attach to an address | No — you can skip photos or use Camera |

Denying any permission does not prevent the App from functioning. Features dependent on denied permissions are gracefully disabled.

## Data Retention

Your data remains on your device until you delete it within the App or uninstall the App. Deleting an address also deletes all associated photos.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The App does not require any personal information to function.

## Changes to This Policy

Updates to this privacy policy will be reflected in App updates distributed via TestFlight or the App Store. The "Last Updated" date at the top will be revised accordingly.
